## Overview

### The challenge

The assignment was to design and develop a book review website to enable a staff member for the book review company to add new content to the website through a form input area. Other options for the staff are the ability to log in to determine which staff member is using the application, they can also view, edit and delete information belong to all the books, authors and publishers. From a user point of view, once landing on the home page they can only browse that page, if a user choses to view a book review they will be prompted to log-in or register. Once logged in users can view all the book reviews, view the author/publisher information and also have the option to leave a comment on book reviews.
